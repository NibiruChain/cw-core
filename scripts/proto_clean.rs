/// ## Procedure
///
/// 1. Walk through all the files in the nibiru-std/src/proto directory.
/// 2. For each file, read its content and identify lines that import types with
///    multiple super components.
/// 3. Classify each import based on the first non-super part, then replace the
///    super components with crate::proto::cosmo or crate::proto::tendemint based
///    on the classification.
/// 4. Write the modified content back to each file.
