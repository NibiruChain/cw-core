### Scratch paper - whitelist contract:

- [ ] Use a new `Member` struct to turn the members into an incentivized testnet reward recipient.
- [ ] test(whitelist): `IsWhitelisted`
- [ ] feat(whitelist): integrate the whitelist item into contract.rs
- [ ] feat(whitelist): perform address validation before adding to any whitelist
- [ ] test(whitelist): query that returns all admins
